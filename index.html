            About Me:
          </h3>
          <p>
            I currently work for Macy's Inc as a Mattress Sales Consultant. I take fitness and health very seriously so you can catch me at a local gym during my free time. Music, mainly EDM, is something I love listening to. Every once in a while, I'll treat myself out by going to a local concert whenever my favorite DJs perform.
          </p>

            My passion to become a software engineer all started because of my father. While he graduated from collegeas a Electronics and Communications Engineer, he eventually became a mainframe programmer for UPS. Seeing him work with his peers during bring-a-child-to-work day inspired me to become like him.

            Being that I graduated from community college with an associate's in computer science, I had experience in coding (mainly c++/java) and working in group projects. Due to unforseen circumstances, I had to stop my education and help out at home. I was then given an opportunity, which i could not pass on, through a collaboration with Guild Education and Macy's to join Thinkful SE bootcamp. Thanks to the program, I can continue my dream of becoming a software engineer  with Thinkful. I am thrilled to start this journey and see the progress I make the next couple of months.
